# Spec Generator (Team)

Generate detailed specification files from a domain-based task breakdown using a coordinated agent team. Each teammate generates specs for their domain and can coordinate on cross-domain interfaces.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` is the name of a task file (maps to `.claude/tasks/$ARGUMENTS.md`).

## Workflow

### 1. Read and validate

Read the task list file from `.claude/tasks/$ARGUMENTS.md`. If it doesn't exist, tell the user and suggest running `/breakdown-team $ARGUMENTS` first.

Verify the file uses **domain format** — it should contain `## Domain:` headers. If it contains `## Group N —` headers instead, tell the user: "This task file uses group format. Use `/spec` instead." and stop.

Parse the file to extract:
- Each domain's label, agent name, and owned files
- All tasks within each domain (items matching `- [ ] **Task title**`)
- The Shared Files table (if present)

### 2. Create output directory

Create `.claude/specs/$ARGUMENTS/` if it doesn't exist.

### 3. Create the team

```
TeamCreate({
  team_name: "spec-$ARGUMENTS",
  description: "Generating specs for $ARGUMENTS"
})
```

### 4. Create tasks and spawn teammates

For each domain in the task file:

1. Call `TaskCreate` with:
   - `subject`: `Generate specs for domain: <domain-label>`
   - `description`: List of all tasks in the domain with their descriptions, files, and coordination points

2. Spawn a teammate via `Agent`:
   ```
   Agent({
     team_name: "spec-$ARGUMENTS",
     name: "spec-<domain-label>",
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     prompt: <see Teammate Prompt below>
   })
   ```

3. Call `TaskUpdate` to assign the task to the teammate (`owner: "spec-<domain-label>"`)

### 5. Teammate Prompt

Each teammate receives:

```
You are a spec-writing agent for the "<domain-label>" domain.

Team: spec-$ARGUMENTS
Your name: spec-<domain-label>

## Your Domain

Files owned: <files owned list>

## Tasks to Spec

<for each task in this domain:>
- **<Task title>** [<size>] [order: <N>]
  <task description>
  Files: <file list>
  Coordinates with: <cross-domain refs>
  Depends on: <within-domain deps>

## Shared Files

<the full Shared Files table from the breakdown>

## Instructions

For each task in your domain:

1. Read the files listed in the task to understand existing code
2. Search for relevant community skills by running `npx skills find <topic>`. If useful, run `npx skills add <owner/repo@skill>` and note it in the spec.
3. Write a spec file to `.claude/specs/$ARGUMENTS/<task-title-kebab>.md` using the format below

After writing all specs, mark your task as completed via TaskUpdate and send a message to the orchestrator confirming completion.

## Spec File Format

# Spec: <Task Title>

> From: .claude/tasks/$ARGUMENTS.md
> Domain: <domain-label>

## Objective

<What this task accomplishes and why>

## Current State

<Relevant existing code/architecture — read the listed files>

## Requirements

- <Specific, testable requirements>

## Implementation Details

- Files to create/modify with descriptions of changes
- Key functions/types/interfaces to add
- Integration points with existing code

## Dependencies

- Depends on (within domain): <tasks that must complete first>
- Coordinates with (cross-domain): <tasks in other domains this interfaces with>

## Coordination Points

- **Shared interface with <other-domain>**: <description of the interface contract>
- **Shared file strategy**: <how to handle shared files per the Shared Files table>

## Risks & Edge Cases

- <Potential issues and mitigations>

## Verification

- <How to confirm this task is done correctly>
```

### 6. Wait for completion

Wait for all teammates to complete their tasks. Monitor via messages received from teammates.

### 7. Coordination review

After all teammates finish:

1. Read all generated spec files from `.claude/specs/$ARGUMENTS/`
2. Check for consistency at coordination points:
   - Do specs that reference the same shared file agree on the interface contract?
   - Do cross-domain `Coordinates with:` references align on both sides?
3. If inconsistencies are found, send `SendMessage` to affected teammates with specific issues to revise
4. Wait for revisions to complete

### 8. Cleanup

1. Send `SendMessage({ type: "shutdown_request" })` to all teammates
2. Call `TeamDelete`
3. List all generated spec files for the user

## Rules

- Do NOT implement any code — only produce spec files
- Each spec must be grounded in the actual codebase (agents must read the listed files)
- Use kebab-case for spec filenames derived from task titles
- After all specs are written, print a summary of all generated files
