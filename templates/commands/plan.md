# Planning Workflow

You are entering **Plan Mode**. Do NOT write any code yet.

## Steps

1. **Understand** — Restate the request in your own words. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous.
2. **Research** — Read relevant files to understand the current architecture and patterns.
3. **Decompose** — Break the work into discrete tasks (max 5). For each task:
   - What files will be created or modified
   - What the change does
   - Dependencies on other tasks
   - Estimated complexity (S/M/L)
4. **Risks** — Identify edge cases, breaking changes, or areas of uncertainty.
5. **Present** — Show the plan and wait for approval before proceeding.

Do NOT implement anything until the user approves the plan.
